# Auto Mailer Pro

Automate personalized insurance mail campaigns with a polished desktop interface. Auto Mailer Pro generates tailored letters, envelopes, mailing labels, and CRM-ready CSV exports for both personal and commercial property prospects. The tool was developed for Jones Insurance Advisors, Inc. and is designed to accelerate follow-up on recent property sales while preventing duplicate outreach to existing clients.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Dual Campaign Modes** – Target *personal* (owner-occupied) or *commercial* audiences with dedicated filtering rules.
- **Guided GUI Workflow** – Select your data file, campaign mode, templates, and signature branding from a themed Tkinter interface.
- **Dynamic Letter Content** – Use default market-ready templates or supply your own subject line and body copy per campaign.
- **Document Automation** – Produce Microsoft Word documents for letters, #10 envelopes, and Avery 5160 mailing labels in one run.
- **CRM Export** – Create a cleaned CSV (`crm_<mode>_occupied.csv`) ready for import into your CRM.
- **Data Hygiene** – Cleans owner names, verifies owner-occupancy, validates business types, maps ZIP codes to city/state, and skips existing clients found in the `master_client_list.xlsx` file.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Launch the Windows executable
1. Copy `AutoMailerPro.exe`, `Logo.png`, `zip_lookup.csv`, `master_client_list.xlsx`, and signature images into the same folder.
2. Double-click `AutoMailerPro.exe`.
3. Follow the on-screen workflow (see [Using the Application](#-using-the-application)).

### Option 2: Run the GUI from source
1. Clone this repository and open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install dependencies (see [Prerequisites](#-prerequisites)).
4. Start the GUI:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Option 3: Automate via Python
If you need to integrate Auto Mailer Pro into another Python workflow, import and call `AutoMailerPro_v5_1.main`:
```python
from AutoMailerPro_v5_1 import main

main(
    mode="personal",                     # or "commercial"
    file_path="/path/to/sales_data.xlsx",
    content=None,                         # defaults to built-in template per mode
    subject_line="Custom subject here",
    signature_name="Brian Jones",
    signature_title="Vice President",
    signature_image="signature_brian.png",
    signature_email="Brian@jonesia.com",
)
```

## 🗂 Preparing Your Data
Auto Mailer Pro expects an Excel file exported from your sales source. The required columns vary by campaign mode:

| Column | Personal Mode | Commercial Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Owner Name` | ✅ | – |
| `Address` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `Mailing Address` | ✅ | – *(uses `Address` in new commercial format)* |
| `Site Zip Code` | ✅ | – |
| `ZIP Code` | – | ✅ *(new commercial format)* |
| `Sale Date` | ✅ | Optional |
| `Sale Price` | ✅ | Optional |
| `Business Type` | – | ✅ *(legacy commercial format)* |
| `Executive First Name` / `Executive Last Name` | – | ✅ *(new commercial format)* |

Additional reference files:
- **`zip_lookup.csv`** – Maps 5-digit ZIP codes to city/state values written to output documents.
- **`master_client_list.xlsx`** – Existing client roster. Any record with a matching name and mailing address is automatically skipped.

> 💡 Tip: Place your sales Excel file in the same directory as the application for easier browsing.

## 🧭 Using the Application
1. **Launch the GUI** via the executable or `python run.py`.
2. **Select Campaign Mode** (`Personal` or `Commercial`). The subject line and default letter template update automatically.
3. **Choose a Letter Template**:
   - `Indian River` and `St. Lucie` presets for both personal and commercial audiences.
   - `Custom` to edit the body copy directly in the GUI.
4. **Pick a Signature Profile** to apply a name, title, email address, and signature image.
5. **Load Sales Data** by clicking **Browse**, then selecting your Excel file.
6. **Adjust Subject Line** if desired. If you type in the subject box, the value stays locked even when switching modes.
7. **Review Letter Content** in the scrollable preview. Custom content is fully editable.
8. Click **Run Campaign**. Progress updates appear in the output console at the bottom of the window.
9. When processing completes, a timestamped folder (e.g., `031224_1430_Personal_Mailing_Campaign`) is created with all generated files.

## 📄 Output Files
Each campaign generates the following assets inside the timestamped output folder:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `all_letters.docx` | Personalized letter for each qualified recipient. Subject line is bolded at the top. |
| `all_envelopes.docx` | #10 envelope layout, one per recipient. |
| `mailing_labels.docx` | Avery 5160-compatible 3×10 sheet of labels. |
| `crm_<mode>_occupied.csv` | Filtered and cleaned contact list for CRM import. |
| `processing_log.txt` *(optional)* | Console output when redirected via GUI (copy from output panel if needed). |

---

## 🛠 Configuration & Customization
- **Templates** – Edit the predefined templates within `run.py` or pass a custom string to `main(content=...)`.
- **Signatures** – Add new entries to the `signature_profiles` dictionary in `run.py`, including the path to a PNG signature.
- **Branding** – Replace `Logo.png` or `logo.ico` to update visuals shown in the GUI and exported letters.
- **Data Rules** – Advanced logic (name cleaning, filtering, CRM export) resides in `AutoMailerPro_v5_1.py`. Adjust the helper functions there for bespoke workflows.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting
| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| *Excel file not found* | Confirm the path shown in the GUI, or move the Excel file into the project directory. |
| *Missing columns* | Ensure your spreadsheet headers exactly match the column names listed in [Preparing Your Data](#-preparing-your-data). |
| *Existing clients still receiving letters* | Update `master_client_list.xlsx` with the latest client roster. Matching is case-insensitive on name and mailing address. |
| *Signature image not loading* | Verify the PNG file exists and is listed in `signature_profiles`. |
| *GUI fails to start due to missing theme assets* | Install `ttkthemes` and `pillow`, then re-run `python run.py`. |
